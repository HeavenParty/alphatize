# What is alphatize?

A quick utility meant to grab images and give them alpha in a COOL way.

This is part of HV quick tooling, distributable and usable with MIT license (see `LICENSE`).

it grabs images from input and outputs them with same name. It takes a fair amount of time: this is not an efficient program.

This also is the start of a script tooling that I made for myself ... so that's cool :)

> Note: this stuff is meant to be used as HV tooling, so it won't come documented extensively unless you're part of HV staff
